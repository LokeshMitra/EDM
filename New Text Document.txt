In the predict salary module our primary aim is to estimate the salary of a employee given his expirence time.
Here we are ustilizing the linear regression model and for implementing it we have to import
sklearn libraries(.linear_model import LinearRegression and .modelselect  traintestsplit)

Here we take the values from the expirience column as input data and corresponding values from the
salary column as target.

We split the input and target values using train_test_split method and get values for
 x_train and y_train variables

 We run fit operation with both as parameters.

Then we ask for  a user provided experience year value through an entry widget and obtain the
salary value using predict method
